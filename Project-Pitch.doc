For my final front-end assignment, I would like to build a basic, responsive and modern website for my husband's cookie business ("Casey's Cookies"). As a local, private business
having a website will show that he is serious about his business. Customers are likely to purchase from a business if they have the ability to do so online, so that's my goal with building
this website. My priority will be to focus on making it responsive for mobile, and I intend to make it minimalistic and sleek looking.
The API I will focus on building will be a Trello to-do list so that Casey and his partners can keep track of the things they need to do, include completing orders and purchasing ingredients.
