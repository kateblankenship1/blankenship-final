For my final front-end assignment, I would like to build a basic, responsive and modern website for my husband's cookie business ("Casey's Cookies"). As a local, private business
having a website will show that he is serious about his business. Customers are likely to purchase from a business if they have the ability to do so online, so that's my goal with building
this website. My priority will be to focus on making it responsive for mobile, and I intend to make it minimalistic and sleek looking.
The API I will focus on building will be a simple login API for repeat customers, probably to make ordering easier (they could look at past orders and copy them and whatnot).
